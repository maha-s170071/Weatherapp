# Weatherapp
The Weather App is an application that allows users to check the current weather and forecast for a location. The app also allows users to search for locations and save their favorite locations for quick access. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data.
# The Weather App has the following screens:

Home Screen: The home screen displays the current weather for the user's current location and a list of the user's favorite locations. The user can tap on a favorite location to see the detail screen for that location.

Search Screen: The search screen allows the user to search for locations by name, city, state, or country. The search results are displayed in a list, and the user can tap on a search result to see the detail screen for that location.

Detail Screen: The detail screen displays the current weather and forecast for a selected location. The user can also add the location to their favorites list from this screen.
